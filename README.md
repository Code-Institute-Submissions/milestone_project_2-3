# Jewellery Repair Shop

My project was designed for people in the Carlow area to be able to find The Repair Shop with a Jewellery Repair Service.

The opening page of my project gives us a brief history and map to show them where the shop is.

## UX

This website is for people that are interested in getting there old jewellery repaired to look like a new piece of jewellery or to get a bespoke piece of jewellery made. This website allows the customer to see who the company is and what they can do.
It also gives the customer a visual experience with pictures work that was done. The contact page allows customers to get in contact with the company direct about work they want done or just a question about a piece of jewellery that they have.
In the footer of every page there is a downloadable price list and links to the social pages where customers can see the work that the company is working on at the moment.

* As a new customer I want to find out more about the company.
* As a new customer I want to know what they are able to do.
* As a new customer can I check what will it cost to fix my item of jewellery.
* As a new customer is it easy to get in contact with him
* As a new customer I want to see worke that has done.

* Gitpod
  * This was the software that I used to write the html, css, javascript and Readme files.
  * It was used to store all the images and files.

  * This was used to create the mark up language.
   
* CSS
  * milestone_project_2/assets/css/styles.css
    * CSS was used to style the elements of the HTML code.

* Javascript 
  * milestone_project_2/assets/js/maps.js
    * Javascript was used to conect Google map with API key to the index.html page
  * milestone_project_2/assets/js/sendEmail.js
    * Javascript/jquery was used to setup the submit button on the contact.html page so it could send emails

* Bootstrap
  * href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  * https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js

    * These were used to create a universal font for the website.

* Hover
  * https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js
    * This was used to have the hover styles run smoothly

* Validators
  * An [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) was used to check the code.
  * A [CSS checker](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used to check the stylings.

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

I started writing the code in gitpod and saving it in the github repositorie, every time I would do somthing new I would run it and right click on the page and inspect it.
