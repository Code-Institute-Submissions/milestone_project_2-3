# Jewellery Repair Service Search

My project was designed for people in there local area to be able to search for a Jewellery Repair Service.

The opening page of my project gives us a brief history 

## UX

This website is for people that are interested in getting there old jewellery redesigned into a new piece of jewellery or looking to get a bespoke piece of jewellery made. This website allows the customer tp see who he is and what
he can do. It also gives the customer a visual experience with pictures and a video of him doing the work. The contact page allows customers to get in contact with him direct about work they want done or just a question about a piece of jewellery that they have.
In the footer of every page there is a downloadable price list and links to his social pages where customers can see the work that he is working on at the moment.
